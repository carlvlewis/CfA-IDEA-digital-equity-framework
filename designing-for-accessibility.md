### A TACTICAL CHECKLIST

By CARL V. LEWIS

If the design of a digital service fails to account for the needs of all users, it will _always_ be a poor design. Inherent in good design is empathy for the user. Empathy for the user means putting personal tastes aside at times for the sake of the unique needs of the person who will be using the service or experience you are developing. Sure, you may like that pallete of different shades of azure blue, but if it isn't a range of colors that an individual who is color-blind can distinguish the differences in, the user will likely not be able to navigate your interface.
