# Who This Guide is For

While geared primarily toward leaders seeking to build and sustain inclusive and equitable civic tech communities of practice and place, the underlying principles of this framework should also resonate more broadly with _any_ grassroots or volunteer-based community or organization seeking to improve the quality of its work and the reach of its vision through broad-based community-building.

Drawing upon existing private sector DEI \(diversity, equity, and inclusion\) best practices as well as open source project "Code of Conduct" documents, this

# Context

Civic tech[^1] communities \(called '[Brigades](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org)' in [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) parlance\) lack a tactical, tailored, and shared framework for designing, implementing, sustaining, and measuring the success of projects and processes that aim to make _inclusion_, _diversity_, _equity_, and _accessibility_ core to their organizational mission.

Historically, civic tech communities have been particularly ill-equipped to foster IDEA given that:

* Civic tech communities have in the past framed themselves around technology, despite the fact that civic tech mainstream orthodox technology is merely a mode for civic engagement and that a technology focus can unintentionally feel exclusionary to the many capable, intelligent, gifted residents who have much to offer the group dynamic but who may not consider themselves 'technology people.'
* Much of the social/reputation status in civic tech communities requires significant free time to volunteer in helping build technology-centric projects. This is exclusionary to two swaths of the broader populace: \(a\) those who lack the needed time away from paid labor and \(b\) those who lack the assumed technology and design skills to make the most significant contributions.

This historically exclusionary nature of civic tech communities becomes even more problematic given the _civic_ component of the work they do. A key pillar of _civic technology_ as most practioners today view it is that the _only_ way to achieve desired outcomes is by "building with, not for," the entire community ––particularly the most vulnerable segments of society who stand to benefit from civic tech projects the most.[^2]

[^1]: _For the purposes of this guide, we use the term 'civic tech' in a broad sense referring to any resident-driven, bottom-up effort to apply iterative and open processes from technology and service design to the machinery of government with the goal of making democratic societies function better for the people. While we recognize the inherent complexities with the term 'civic tech,'  and are aware of its potential to be interpreted as more about technology than about civic duty, we also acknowledge the lack of a more precise term, as well as the fact that a common lexicon that has developed around it. We do wish to distinguish, however, that for the purposes of this guide, we view 'gov tech' and 'civic tech' as having different meanings. While 'gov tech' chiefly is built by and for the benefit of the government from the top-down \(and thus reinforces existing norms\), 'civic tech' is inherently resident-centric._
