# Context

Civic tech communities \(call '[Brigades](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org)' in Code for America parlance\) lack a tactical, tailored, and shared framework for designing, implementing, sustaining, and scaling projects that aim to make inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility core to their organizational mission. Historically, civic tech communities have been particularly ill-equipped to foster IDEA – a reality that becomes even more problematic given the civic component of the work they do. A key pillar of civic technology as most practioners today view it is that the _only_ way to achieve desired outcomes is by building with, not for, the entire community ––particularly the most vulnerable segments of society who stand to benefit from civic tech projects the most.

CfA's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility \(_**IDEA**_\) Brigade Action Team \(BAT\) is the first organized and structured inter-brigade effort to exchange knowledge and resources to develop a shared framework for IDEA efforts across the brigade network. This collective effort should result in the creation of a DEI Toolkit that is open-sourced, reproducible, and shared with all brigade members, and adaptable by the constituents they serve, and other organizations.

# Goals {#making-inclusion-and-digital-equity-projects-a-core-part-of-brigades-work-in-the-communities-they-serve}

* To make inclusion and digital equity projects a core part of Brigades' work in the communities they serve
* To lay the groundwork and align resources for a structured toolkit for IDEA efforts; creating shared metrics for progress.
* To make diversity and inclusion efforts more than cheap platitudes.
* To provide a set of common best-practices for avoiding exclusionary practices.

# Scope {#making-inclusion-and-digital-equity-projects-a-core-part-of-brigades-work-in-the-communities-they-serve}

​The scope of the BAT is to align efforts and resources and create an action plan that identifies IDEA BAT projects that all participating brigades can work on and a framework that can be deployed successfully for any brigade project process. This action plan will also create timelines and milestones so that all success criteria \(metrics\) are completed. Our proposed timeline for this scope is eight months.

The scope of the BAT with start and end time; which should be no more than 12 months. Successful and ongoing BATs can renew their teams after one year. \*
