# Goals {#making-inclusion-and-digital-equity-projects-a-core-part-of-brigades-work-in-the-communities-they-serve}

* To make inclusion, group diversity, digital equity, and accessibility \(IDEA\) projects a core part of Brigades' work in the communities they serve
* To lay the groundwork and align resources for a structured toolkit for IDEA efforts.
* To codify shared metrics for progress, when possible \(i.e. _inclusion_ is not easily quantified\)
* To make diversity efforts more than cheap platitudes; to spread understanding that diversity is simply an endpoint fix – a band-aid if you will – to deeper issues of exclusion that pervade societal norms.
* To provide a set of common best-practices for avoiding exclusionary practices.
* To conduct a network-wide confidential but email-address verified survey of inclusion sentiment, then analyze the results of said survey in follow-up report; no brigade-level data will be compiled, nor will any names be tied to responses. See OpenOakland DEI survey.
* To place accessibility where it rightly belongs – right alongside DEI – in a world in which designing accessible interfaces is becoming more and more critical as a requirement, not a 'nice-to-have' feature.
  * To spread awareness of the various types of accessibility issues in civic product design, and to develop user testing heuristics specifically to measure a project's accessibility.

# Intended Outcome {#making-inclusion-and-digital-equity-projects-a-core-part-of-brigades-work-in-the-communities-they-serve}

We hope this framework will help spark a network-wide dialogue on taking more cognizant, deliberative, and codified actions to mitigate exclusionary conditions, and help begin to foster an organizational ethos for civic tech that rightly puts the _individual_ at the center, not the project or deliverables. By the _individual_, we mean _all_ individuals.
