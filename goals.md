# Goals {#making-inclusion-and-digital-equity-projects-a-core-part-of-brigades-work-in-the-communities-they-serve}

In recent years, various initiatives have emerged to harness the possibilities offered by digital technology in order to improve or renew democracy. Amidst the crisis of our Western democracies, undermined by a growing gap between citizens and their representatives, by abstention and by the rise of extremism, civic technology revives the democratic process by improving information, enabling greater citizen participation and empowerment, and ultimately enhancing the delivery of government services to those who rely upon them the most.

digital-age principles and patterns to the causes of social justice and equality under the law that western liberal democracies espouse.

 that uses digital principles, practices, and capacities to create conditions in which all residents receive equitable, just, and high-quality services from government, 

To make inclusion, group diversity, digital equity, and accessibility \(IDEA\) projects a core part of Brigades' work in the communities they serve

* To lay the groundwork and align resources for a structured toolkit for IDEA efforts.
* To codify shared metrics for progress, when possible \(i.e. _inclusion_ is not easily quantified\)
* To make diversity efforts more than cheap platitudes; to spread understanding that diversity is simply an endpoint fix – a band-aid if you will – to deeper issues of exclusion that pervade societal norms.
* To provide a set of common best-practices for avoiding exclusionary practices.
* To conduct a network-wide confidential but verified survey of inclusion sentiment and analyze the results of said survey in follow-up report; no brigade-level data will be compiled, nor will any names be tied to responses.
* To place accessibility where it rightly belongs – right alongside DEI – in a world in which designing accessible interfaces is becoming more and more critical as a requirement, not a 'nice-to-have' feature.
  * To spread awareness of the various types of accessibility issues in civic product design, and to develop user testing heuristics specifically to measure a project's accessibility.

# Intended Outcome {#making-inclusion-and-digital-equity-projects-a-core-part-of-brigades-work-in-the-communities-they-serve}

It is our hope that this framework will help spark a much-needed network-wide dialogue about how to take more cognizant actions away from exclusionary behavior and toward an organizational ethos for civic tech that rightly puts the individual at the center.
