# Context

Civic tech[^1] communities \(called '[Brigades](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org)' in [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) parlance\) lack a tactical, tailored, and shared framework for designing, implementing, sustaining, and measuring the success of projects and processes that aim to make _inclusion_, _diversity_, _equity_, and _accessibility_ core to their organizational mission.

Historically, civic tech communities have been particularly ill-equipped to foster IDEA given that:

* Civic tech communities have in the past framed themselves around technology, despite the fact that civic tech mainstream orthodox technology is merely a mode for civic engagement and that a technology focus can unintentionally feel exclusionary to the many capable, intelligent, gifted residents who have much to offer the group dynamic but who may not consider themselves 'technology people.'
* Much of the group clout in civic tech communities requires significant free time to volunteer in helping build projects.

* 
– a reality that becomes even more problematic given the civic component of the work they do. A key pillar of civic technology as most practioners today view it is that the _only_ way to achieve desired outcomes is by building with, not for, the entire community ––particularly the most vulnerable segments of society who stand to benefit from civic tech projects the most.

CfA's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility \(_**IDEA**_\) Brigade Action Team \(BAT\) is the first organized and structured inter-brigade effort to exchange knowledge and resources to develop a shared framework for IDEA efforts across the brigade network. This collective effort should result in the creation of a DEI Toolkit that is open-sourced, reproducible, and shared with all brigade members, and adaptable by the constituents they serve, and other organizations.

[^1]: _For the purposes of this guide, we use the term 'civic tech' in the broadest sense possible–that of resident-driven, bottom-up efforts to apply the principles of modern technology and service design to the machinery of government with the goal of making democratic societies function better for all people. We recognize the inherent complexities with the term 'civic tech,'  and are aware of its potential to be interpreted as more about technology than about civic duty and community. _
